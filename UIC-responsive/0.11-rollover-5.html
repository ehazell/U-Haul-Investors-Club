            			  			<p>The account holder named in Part Two of the Self Directed IRA Custodial Account Application ("Depositor") is establishing a self-directed individual retirement account (a "Custodial Account") with Oxford Life Insurance Company, as the custodian ("Custodian"). By signing below, Depositor agrees to all of the terms in this Agreement, including the terms of the attached IRA Custodial Account Agreement (Form 5305-A for a Traditional IRA and Form 5305-RA for a Roth IRA), which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement. The Depositor and the Custodian make the following agreement:
									ARTICLE I INVESTMENT PROVISIONS
									Appointment of Custodian: Depositor appoints Custodian as the custodian of the Custodial Account. Depositor acknowledges that Depositor has received and read the disclosures Custodian provided pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.408-6 on the date that Depositor signed this Agreement. All contributions shall be invested by the Custodian as directed by the Depositor. In accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.408-6, Depositor has the right to revoke this Agreement and close the Custodial Account within seven (7) days from the date that Depositor signed this Agreement, without payment of fees or expenses to Custodian, by mailing or delivering a written notice to Custodian.
									Availability of Funds: Because of Depositor's right to revoke described above, funds deposited into a new Custodial Account cannot be invested until expiration of the seven (7) day revocation period. Any checks deposited into the Custodial Account will not be available until Custodian receives confirmation of final settlement of payment on the check from Custodian's bank.
									Uninvested Cash: Custodian will automatically place all deposits received from or on behalf of Depositor into a non-interest bearing FDIC-insured bank account until such funds are invested at Depositor's direction.
									Withdrawal Requests: All requests for withdrawal shall be on a form provided by the Custodian. In order to verify final settlement of deposits prior to a withdrawal, funds will not be available for withdrawal until 30 days after deposit in the Custodial Account.
									ARTICLE II SELF-DIRECTED IRA PROVISIONS
									Investment of Contributions: At the direction of the Depositor, the Custodian shall invest all contributions to the Custodial Account and earnings thereon in investments, provided that such investments that are considered administratively feasible by the Custodian in the Custodian's sole discretion. However, if any such investment directions are unclear in the opinion of the Custodian, all or a portion of the contribution may be held uninvested without liability for loss of income or appreciation, and without liability for interest pending receipt of such orders or clarification, or the contribution may be returned. The Custodian shall have no duty other than to follow the written investment directions of the Depositor, and shall be under no duty to question said instructions and shall not be liable for any investment losses sustained by the Depositor under any circumstances.
									Designated Representative: The Depositor may appoint a Designated Representative to direct the investment of the Custodial Account, or a specified portion of the Custodial Account. The Depositor shall notify the Custodian of any such appointment by providing the Custodian a representative designation form acceptable to the Custodian. The Custodian shall comply with any investment directions furnished to it by the Designated Representative, unless and until it receives written notification from the Depositor that the Designated Representative's appointment has been terminated.

				The U-Haul Investors Club<sup>&reg;</sup> was founded by AMERCO&reg; and U-Haul International, Inc., the leader in the "do-it-yourself" moving and self-storage business. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Traditionally, U-Haul assets were purchased with capital raised from lenders or through security issuance. Throughout the years, there has been a reliance on banks and intermediaries for funding. As a "do-it-yourself" company, we have developed an alternative measure to provide investors with the ability to invest directly in U-Notes&reg;, issued by AMERCO, our parent company, through the U-Haul Investors Club&reg;.</p>
			<p><strong>Our goal is to provide our investors with a fair return on asset backed investments.</strong>
