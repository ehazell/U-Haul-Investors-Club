					<p>
						You will need to provide an email address, mailing address, phone number, your birthday, a government issued ID number (such as driver license number, state-issued ID number, military ID number or passport number) and your social security number in order for the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; to enroll you as a <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; member. The information collected is for the purpose of tax reporting and other federal regulations, and you will be responsible for notifying <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; of any changes to this information. Once you have signed up, and before you start investing, you will have to provide your bank account information so that your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account can be linked to your external bank account. Membership to the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; is limited to U.S. residents.</p>
					<h4>How do I add/withdraw funds?</h4>
					<p>
						You will need a checking or savings account linked to your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account in order to add or withdraw funds.  If you are a member and have not established the link, please sign in and click on “Add funds to your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account.”  You will then be prompted to enter information with respect to your existing bank account.  For your security, the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; will make two small withdrawals (under $1) from your bank account.  When your bank account has been debited, return to http://www.uhaulinvestorsclub.com/, sign in and verify the amount of the debit.  This amount will automatically be returned to your bank account in a few business days.  You must verify your account in order to proceed with investing in U-Notes&reg;.</p>

					<p>
						Fund transfers are processed through ACH (Automated Clearing House). Funds usually post to your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account after 3-4 business days.</p>
					<h4>How long does it take for the funds to transfer from my <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account to my bank account?</h4>
					<p>
						Fund transfers are processed through ACH (Automated Clearing House).  If you initiate a transfer of funds from your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account to your linked bank account, such funds will usually post to your bank account after 3-4 business days.  Please note that in order to ensure sufficient funds, there may be up to a thirty (30) day hold on the funds you transferred from your bank account to the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account.  Therefore, you cannot withdraw the funds you deposited to your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account in the first 30 calendar days.  For IRA transactions, please click here.</p>
					<h4>Does the uninvested cash in my <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account earn interest?</h4>
					<p>
						No, interest is not earned on cash in your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account.</p>
					<h4>Where can I get more detailed information before I invest in U-Notes&reg;?</h4>
					<p>
						View AMERCO prospectus and prospectus supplements for details on the risks, and terms and conditions of investing in U-Notes&reg;.  Additionally, the applicable prospectus supplement for each U-Notes&reg; offering can be viewed under the "view full details" link on the "investment opportunities" tab.  The prospectus supplement must be read by investors and prospective investors before making a decision to invest in such U-Notes&reg; offering.</p>
					<h4>Are the principal and interest payments on my U-Notes&reg; automatically reinvested?</h4>
					<p>
						No, your principal and interest payments are not automatically reinvested.  However, you may subscribe to purchase additional U-Notes&reg; with the funds in your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account.  Neither the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg;, nor AMERCO and its affiliates, provide investment advice. </p>
					<h4>When the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; makes a payment on my <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span>, does the payment go directly to my bank account?</h4>
					<p>
						No. Payments on your U-Notes&reg; are credited to your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account.  You have the choice to (i) leave those funds as uninvested in your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account. Please note that any such uninvested funds do not accrue interest; (ii) reinvest those funds in other U-Notes&reg;; or (iii) withdraw the funds by initiating a fund transfer from your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account to your linked bank account. Please follow the steps on the website in order to initiate a fund transfer. You may transfer funds out of your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account once per week (Sunday through Saturday) without fees. For any additional transfers, you will be charged a transfer fee. Please note that in order to ensure sufficient funds, there may be up to a thirty (30) day hold before the funds are transferred from your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account to your linked bank account.</p>
					<h4>Is my investment guaranteed by the FDIC?</h4>
					<p>
						No. U-Notes&reg; are not savings accounts, deposit accounts or money market funds and are not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve or any other governmental agency. View AMERCO's prospectus and prospectus supplements for details on the risks, terms and conditions of investing with <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg;.</p>
					<h4>Will I be able to sell my U-Notes&reg;?</h4>
					<p>
						There is no secondary market for you to post or sell U-Notes&reg;. However, you are entitled to transfer your <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> to another investor as long as he/she is a <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; member. The transfer and re-title fee is $25 per transfer (fee subject to change). Accordingly, you must be prepared to hold each <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> investment until its respective maturity date.</p>
					<h4>Will I be able to trade my U-Notes&reg;?</h4>
					<p>
						No, you are not able to trade U-Notes&reg;. There is no secondary market for U-Notes&reg;. Accordingly, you must be prepared to hold each <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> investment until its respective maturity date.</p>
					<h4>Is a <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> comparable to a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a savings account?</h4>
					<p>
						No, a <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> is not comparable to a CD or a savings account.  When you purchase a <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span>, you are lending money to AMERCO.  AMERCO repays that loan by making scheduled repayments to you through the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg;.  These repayments usually include both principal and interest.  The principal repayments reduce your existing <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> balance.  Your interest payments are calculated based on the current outstanding principal balance left on your <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span>.    Before investing, you should review the payout schedule of your proposed <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> investment by clicking on 'View payment schedule' under the full details of a <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span>.  In addition, unlike most CDs and savings accounts, U-Notes&reg; are not FDIC insured and cannot be redeemed (or 'cashed-out') by you at your option under any circumstances.  U-Notes&reg; must be held by investors until the stated maturity date, unless earlier redeemed by AMERCO in its sole discretion.</p>
					<h4>How does the Refer-a-Friend program work?</h4>
					<p>
						The Refer-a-Friend program is available to <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; members who have owned a <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span>.  You may send out referrals to the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; to as many people as you would like. Your account will be credited when your friend joins the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg;, subscribes to purchase a <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> and the <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> is issued to that person.  You may receive referral credits for up to five friends per twelve-month period of time starting when you receive your first credit.  Each credit is currently worth $25 towards your <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> purchase, and you can only use it to purchase U-Notes&reg;.  The Refer-a-Friend program may be discontinued by the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; at anytime without prior notice.</p>
					<h4>My name has changed. How can I reflect this name-change on my <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account?</h4>
					<p>
						Please contact the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; at info@uhaulinvestorsclub.com or fax (602) 263-6825 and supply a copy of (i) your driver's license or other form of government issued identification that shows your name before you made the legal name change, and (ii) the legal documentation to support your name change (Example: Your marriage certificate).  For business entities, please supply the name-change documentation issued by the applicable Secretary of State office or other governing body.</p>
					<h4>I forgot my password or my email address, what should I do?</h4>
					<p>
						On the sign in page click 'Trouble signing in?' to recover or reset your sign in information.</p>
					<h4>Is the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; open to residents of Canada?</h4>
					<p>
						The <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; is currently only available to U.S. residents.   AMERCO may consider extending the program to Canadian residents in the future.</p>
					<h4>What if the collateral securing my <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> is stolen, lost, damaged, destroyed or taken under a condemnation?</h4>
					<p>
						While any form of loss or damage to the asset will reduce the value of your collateral, AMERCO's obligation to repay the <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> in full will continue to exist.  In the event of a loss, you will remain secured in the remaining collateral securing your <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span>.  AMERCO has no obligation to replace or repair collateral.  In the event of such a loss, AMERCO will have the choice to redeem the remaining balance of the <span class="nobreak">U-Note&reg;</span> or to continue making the scheduled payments.    Please refer to the prospectus and the prospectus supplements for more detailed information.</p>
					<h4>Are the <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; offerings a typical corporate bond?</h4>
					<p>
						No.  Corporate bonds are typically not secured by any collateral and are issued by underwriters from investment banks.  Corporate bonds are often listed on major exchanges and have credit ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies.  At <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg;, no underwriters or other third-party have been engaged to facilitate the sale of the Notes in the offerings.  U-Notes&reg; are backed by collateral, and they are not listed on any exchange and are not rated by any credit rating agencies.</p>
					<h4>Can I cancel my subscription to purchase U-Notes&reg;?</h4>
					<p>
						Your subscription to purchase U-Notes&reg; can be canceled 24 hours prior to the day on which AMERCO closes the offering.  Upon the day of closing of the offering, your subscription to purchase U-Notes&reg; will be irrevocable.</p>
					<h4>Can I transfer funds from my 401K or other employer sponsored retirement plans to my <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; IRA even if I remain employed?</h4>
					<p>
						In many cases, you may be eligible to transfer the funds if you are 59 ½ or older. However, every plan is different so please contact your employer and your financial advisor before you initiate the fund transfer.</p>
					<h4>What information do I need to initiate a direct transfer from my current IRA/401K provider to my <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; IRA?</h4>
					<p>
						You need to know your current IRA/401K provider's company name, address, phone number and account number, which can be found in your monthly/quarterly statements. You may also obtain this information by contacting your current IRA/401K provider.</p>
					<h4>Is there any fee to initiate IRA contributions or distributions (ie. make a deposit or withdrawal to/from my <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; account)?</h4>
					<p>
						While Oxford Life Insurance Company, the custodian for <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; IRAs, does not charge a fee on IRA contributions or distributions, you may want to check with your existing retirement plan provider(s) or your financial institutions to find out if they charge any fees before initiating a transfer of funds to your <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; IRA. AMERCO will not be responsible for fees charged by a third party, so any fees charged by your existing retirement plan provider(s) and financial institution(s) will not be paid or reimbursed by <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg;.</p>
					<h4>How many beneficiaries can be added to my accounts?</h4>
					<p>
						You can have one primary beneficiary and one contingent beneficiary per account. You may create additional accounts with different beneficiaries.</p>
					<h4>If I start a <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; IRA today, when will I be able to start investing?</h4>
					<p>
						The waiting period may vary depend on your contribution method. First, every new IRA account will need to pass the 7-day IRA revocation period mandated by IRS before the account becomes active. After the 7th calendar day, Oxford Life (the custodian for <span class="nobreak">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; IRAs) will then initiate your fund transfer through ACH or deposit your check if it has been received. While an IRA's ACH transaction will typically take 7-8 days after the 7th revocation day, a direct transfer may take up to several weeks depending on your current IRA provider.</p>
					<h4>What is the 7-day revocation period?</h4>
					<p>
						As required by federal law, you have the right to revoke your IRA by delivering a written revocation notice to the custodian within 7 days after establishing the IRA. If you revoke your IRA, you are entitled to receive a return of all funds you contributed to the IRA.</p>

				The U-Haul Investors Club<sup>&reg;</sup> was founded by AMERCO&reg; and U-Haul International, Inc., the leader in the "do-it-yourself" moving and self-storage business. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Traditionally, U-Haul assets were purchased with capital raised from lenders or through security issuance. Throughout the years, there has been a reliance on banks and intermediaries for funding. As a "do-it-yourself" company, we have developed an alternative measure to provide investors with the ability to invest directly in U-Notes&reg;, issued by AMERCO, our parent company, through the U-Haul Investors Club&reg;.</p>
			<p><strong>Our goal is to provide our investors with a fair return on asset backed investments.</strong>
