							The <span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; was founded by AMERCO&reg; and <span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> International, Inc., the leader in the "do-it-yourself" moving and self-storage business. Traditionally, <span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> assets were purchased with capital raised from lenders or through security issuance. Throughout the years, there has been a reliance on banks and intermediaries for funding. As a "do-it-yourself" company, we have developed an alternative measure to provide investors with the ability to invest directly in U-Notes&reg;, issued by AMERCO, our parent company, through the <span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg;. Our goal is to provide our investors with a fair return on asset backed investments.
						</p>
						<p>
							The idea of the <span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; was inspired by social lending and crowdfunding. Based on this concept, we have brought social lending to the corporate level. Our system gives individuals a simple and inexpensive way to invest directly in asset-backed securities. As a result, U-Notes&reg; are a hybrid of a traditional corporate note and social lending with a strong asset-backed feature. All investments by <span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; members are done in a self-direct manner, as we do not provide investment advice to our members.

							<span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> has been in operation since 1945. You may have seen one of our self-storage centers in your neighborhood, or you may have driven one of our rental trucks. In the <span class="nowrap">U-Haul</span> Investors Club&reg; you have the choice to invest U-Notes&reg;, backed by a specific group of assets, not relying on an investment broker, but investing directly through this website. Together, we can all benefit through this value-based investing platform.
